Using the command bellow we are able to execute a CSharp class file without anything installed, but it is a Windows thing.


1 > c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe Program.txt 
2 > Program.exe

The first line will compile the txt file we give to the compiler csc. In that case it is Program.txt.
Then whe execute the generated executable.
